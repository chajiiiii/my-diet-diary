# My Diet Diary

## Description

"My Diet Diary" is a straightforward web application designed for diet tracking. Users can log their daily meals and dietary details, create new entries, edit existing records, and delete entries as necessary. Additionally, users have the option to manage their profiles, including adding a short bio and uploading an avatar.

This project was developed independently and completed within a seven-day timeframe.

## Key Learnings & Wins

### - Displaying posts by dates and meal types

```JavaScript
async function index(req, res) {
  try {
    const mealTypeOrder = {
      breakfast: 1,
      lunch: 2,
      dinner: 3,
      snack: 4,
    };

    const posts = await Post.find({ profile: profile._id }).sort({
      mealDate: -1,
      mealType: 1,
    });

    const dateGroups = {};

    posts.forEach((post) => {
      const dateKey = post.mealDate.toDateString();

      if (!dateGroups[dateKey]) {
        dateGroups[dateKey] = [];
      }

      dateGroups[dateKey].push(post);
    });

    const sortedDateGroups = Object.entries(dateGroups).sort(
      ([dateA], [dateB]) => new Date(dateB) - new Date(dateA)
    );

    sortedDateGroups.forEach(([date, posts]) => {
      posts.sort((a, b) => {
        const mealTypeA = a.mealType.toLowerCase();
        const mealTypeB = b.mealType.toLowerCase();

        return mealTypeOrder[mealTypeA] - mealTypeOrder[mealTypeB];
      });
    });

    res.render("posts/index", {
      dateGroups: sortedDateGroups,
      title: "My Diet Diary",
      posts,
      profile: profile,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    res.redirect("posts");
  }
}
```

I organized and displayed posts in a user-friendly manner, first by date and then by meal type, with proper error handling in place to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Challenges

This was my first time working with backend development, and I encountered some difficulties while trying to analyze the user object and establish links with the post and profile models.
